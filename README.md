# Recipe Generator Console App

Welcome to my Recipe Generator Console App! This project is a fun and creative JavaScript application that generates a unique, whimsical recipe each time it is executed. I built this project to showcase my skills in JavaScript, randomization, and clean coding practices. It’s a great example of how I can take a simple concept and turn it into an engaging, interactive experience.

## Overview

The Recipe Generator is a console-based application written in JavaScript. Each execution produces a randomized recipe complete with:

- A creative recipe name (e.g., *Master Chef Anastasia's Feast*)
- A list of required and optional cooking tools and ingredients
- Detailed, step-by-step cooking instructions

This project demonstrates my ability to use JavaScript to manipulate arrays, generate random outputs, and create an engaging user experience—all while maintaining clean and readable code.
